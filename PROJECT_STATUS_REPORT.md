## 🚀 **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (In Order):**

### **Step 1: Set Up BigQuery** (5 minutes)

```sql
-- Go to Google Cloud Console → BigQuery
-- Run the commands in infra/bigquery-schemas.sql
```

### **Step 2: Deploy Cloud Function** (10 minutes)

```bash
cd function
gcloud functions deploy uploadLeagueData \
  --runtime nodejs18 \
  --trigger-http \
  --allow-unauthenticated
```

### **Step 3: Test Data Upload** (5 minutes)

```bash
# Call your function to populate BigQuery
curl -X POST https://YOUR_FUNCTION_URL/uploadLeagueData
```

### **Step 4: Start Local Server** (2 minutes)

```bash
cd server
npm start
```

### **Step 5: Test Frontend** (2 minutes)

- Open `index.html` in browser
- Should see real data from BigQuery!

- Ensure BigQuery API is enabled

### **If Cloud Function Fails:**

- Check service account permissions
- Verify BigQuery dataset exists
- Check function logs in Cloud Console

### **If Frontend Shows No Data:**

- Make sure server is running (`npm start`)
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify BigQuery has data
